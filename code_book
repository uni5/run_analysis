Xtrain – training dataset

Xtest – test dataset

XTrainTest – train and test datasets combined into one dataframe

features – list of all features as in features.txt

mean_positions – contains positions (index) of variables containing string “mean” within the second column of the “features” data frame – position of all the average labels

std_positions - contains positions (index) of variables containing string “std” within the second column of the “features” data frame – position of all the standard deviation labels

positions – combination of the mean_positions and std_positions in an ascending order

mean_and_std_XTrainTest – a subset of XTrainTest dataframe that contains only the mean and standard deviation variables

train_subject – data frame containing “subject_train.txt” dataset

test_subject – data frame containing “subject_test.txt” dataset

subject – combination of train_subject and test_subject datasets

train_label – training labels (“y_train.txt”)

test_label – test labels (“y_test.txt”)

TrainTest_label – all labels (train_label and test_label combined)

activity_labels – activity labels (“activity_labels.txt”)

var_names – stores the names of the variables

new_var_names – used to create neat labels for variable names from “var_names” 

tidy_data_set – a tidy data set created as a product of running run_analysis.R script
